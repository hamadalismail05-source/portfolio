# Portfolio Website

This project is a simple, responsive website built with HTML, CSS and
vanilla JavaScript. It introduces you as a developer, highlights your
skills (Python and JavaScript) and provides an overview of sample
projects. The layout adapts to different screen sizes and features a
contact form.

## Running Locally

Because this is a static website, you can open `index.html` directly
in your browser. Alternatively, for a more realistic setup you can
serve the files with a simple HTTP server. For example, using Python:

```bash
cd portfolio_site
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

## Structure

```
portfolio_site/
├── index.html  # Main page of the portfolio
├── style.css   # Styles for layout, typography and responsive design
└── script.js   # Optional JavaScript for interactivity
```

## Customisation

- Update the text content in `index.html` to reflect your own
  background, skills, and experiences.
- Replace placeholder images with your own photos or illustrations.
- Modify `style.css` to change colours, fonts and spacing.
- Extend `script.js` to add more interactivity if needed.
